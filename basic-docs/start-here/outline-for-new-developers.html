The developer's assets are not full blockchain coins, but rather only tokens, also called colored coins, that are bound to the limitations of the parent chain. In many circumstances, your end-users pay gas and transaction fees in the coin of the layer-one chain, regardless of your end-users' objectives.</p> <p>Lets compare a blockchain platform to a vehicle. With those other blockchain platforms, it is as though you are paying to ride in their car, you pay a very high price for that seat, and your end-users have to sit in your lap.</p> <p>In Komodo, you get the whole car all to yourself. Add any features you want, change whatever you like, and even import the open-source designs from other blockchain ecosystems.</p> <p>All that is required is that you keep the basic Komodo blockchain framework in place, as it facilitates your connection to <a href="/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html#secure-this-asset-chain-with-delayed-proof-of-work">the security of the Bitcoin hash rate</a> that we provide, and also your connection to other Komodo asset chains and features.</p> <h3 id="no-gas-transaction-fees"><a href="#no-gas-transaction-fees" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> No Gas/Transaction Fees</h3> <p>Unlike other blockchain platforms, on Komodo your end-users do not have to pay gas/transaction fees in KMD for each transaction. Instead, you get to decide what is required, and we feature many tools to facilitate your approach.</p> <h3 id="limitless-scalability-on-demand"><a href="#limitless-scalability-on-demand" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Limitless Scalability On Demand</h3> <p>Because your asset chain is its own independent blockchain, your scalability is limitless and is not affected by activity elsewhere in the Komodo ecosystem.</p> <p>If another asset chain in the Komodo ecosystem has a sudden surge of activity, your asset chain does not slow down at all, as you are both on entirely separate blockchains.</p> <p>On the other hand, if activity on your asset chain hits an extremely high rate and causes your chain to get congested, you can split your asset chain into two linked asset chains. Using this method, we have already proved that the Komodo ecosystem can run more than 40,000 transactions per second, and we are prepared to scale to 1,000,000 and beyond.</p> <p>Your creativity is not limited by the mathematical constraints that affect other blockchain platforms, but instead only by hardware and your imagination.</p> <p>If you want to write the first Uber-like dApp, Komodo is the platform for you.</p> <h3 id="interoperability-is-a-cinch"><a href="#interoperability-is-a-cinch" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Interoperability is a Cinch</h3> <p>Because our initial concept was to create a network of secure independent blockchains, we designed our network from the ground-up for interoperability.</p> <p>For example, you can run as many asset chains as you want, and through our cross-chain burn protocol, you can burn coins or tokens on one asset chain and have them show up on another.</p> <p>Or, maybe you want to write a smart contract that coordinates with a business partner's asset chain? Not a problem. Our technology allows you to monitor and update your chain's state and smart contracts using SPV technology to make observations of other asset chains and participating third-party blockchains.</p> <p>What if you want to trade value directly with blockchains outside the Komodo ecosystem? We've got you covered. With our atomic-swap powered decentralized exchange, BarterDEX, you can swap coins with any blockchain that is based on either Bitcoin or Ethereum. We also have smart-contract technology that allows you to build decentralized gateways or bridges to other blockchain networks of your choice.</p> <h3 id="built-in-zero-knowledge-privacy"><a href="#built-in-zero-knowledge-privacy" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Built-in Zero-knowledge Privacy</h3> <p>Many blockchain platforms say they'll have privacy some day, but how and when they'll get there remains a mystery.</p> <p>In Komodo, we knew privacy would be an essential feature for any developer with a good head on their shoulders. That's why we started our platform as a fork of <a href="https://z.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zcash<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> (which is itself a fork of <a href="https://bitcoin.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>).</p> <p>This allows us to provide built-in zero-knowledge technology, which is a special kind of privacy tech. Other types of privacy typically only attempt to hide your trail by blending your transaction history with other users. Those other types of privacy can protect you for some time, but not forever. Because your blended data is given to the public domain, as quantum-computing technology advances it will likely be able to unravel your currency trail -- and your privacy.</p> <p>Zero-knowledge technology is much stronger. It moves your coins from one address to another with no data leftover in the public domain for later analysis. The way it works inside the blockchain engine is pretty complicated, but lucky for you, you don't have to worry about how it works.

We are actively working to build up our library of smart-contract templates, and will therefore do what we can to help you safely code your smart-contract idea and add it to your daemon.</p> <p>This offer is only available for a limited time, and only on an &quot;as is&quot; basis.</p> <p>Over time, as the library of secure smart-contract templates increases, it is possible that the need to create new smart-contract templates will decrease.

While the initial setup cost may or may not be higher than other blockchain platforms, the benefits that come from owning your own full blockchain, not having to pay KMD gas/transaction fees, and in being able to deploy unlimited smart contracts and ERC20-like tokens on your chain; can become a cost-saving advantage over time for both you and your end-users.</p> <p>Please reach out to our team whenever you are ready to purchase dPoW.

This low-level code may, for example, change the nature of your consensus mechanism, or provide a foundational smart-contract template that can be called from outside the daemon to be used in a dApp.</p> <p>Code that runs outside the daemon can be high-level. A dApp that is built on existing smart-contract templates can exist entirely outside the daemon. It could consist of GUI's, back-end databases, and other non-daemon code and assets that make your dApp function.</p> <p>In both circumstances, you are able to use whatever language you desire.</p> <p>However, if you are working within the daemon, we currently recommend that you have a considerable amount of programming experience, and that you work primarily in C/C++. These are the native languages of the Komodo daemon. When making adjustments to your coin's daemon, other languages can be supported, depending on the circumstances. It may incur an additional cost. Please reach out to our team with your questions.</p> <p>For anything that occurs outside of the daemon, naturally you may use any language that can throw an rpc call to your coin's daemon. Most common languages support this functionality. We are working to create wrappers for importing Komodo functionality into your workflow. If you have a language that is not yet available, we welcome you to create a wrapper and contribute it to <a href="https://www.github.com/komodoplatform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Github repository<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.
